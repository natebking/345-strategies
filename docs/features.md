# Features, One by One

Every feature in TheStrat Suite: what it does, where its settings live, and which doc goes deeper. This is the reference page — when someone asks "does it do X," the answer is on this page or it doesn't exist yet.

Applies to v3.0.0. Settings paths refer to the indicator's settings panel groups.

## Detection

**Six-timeframe engine.** The Suite monitors up to six timeframes at once from a single chart — bar classification, signals, and continuity on each. Presets configure all six in one click: TheStrat Classic, Scalp, Day Trade, Futures/Crypto, Swing Trade, Investing, or Custom for your own set. Settings: *Timeframe Preset*, *Timeframes*. Deep dive: [architecture](engineering/architecture.md), [htf-correctness](engineering/htf-correctness.md).

**Bar classification.** Every candle typed against the prior candle's range: inside (1), directional (2u/2d), outside (3u/3d), with Failing 2s (F2u/F2d) as a modifier. The same classifier feeds the chart, the table, and the alerts, so they can never disagree. Deep dive: [bar-types](concepts/bar-types.md).

**Strat combo labels.** Signals are labeled in standard Strat notation (`2d-1-2u HAM`), oldest to newest, with `*` marking potential setups that haven't triggered. Settings: *Display - Labels*. Deep dive: [reading-labels](concepts/reading-labels.md).

**Inside Reversals.** C1 inside, current candle breaks against C2's direction. On by default. Filters: HAM/SHO, FTFC. Deep dive: [signals](concepts/signals.md).

**2-2 Reversals.** Direct reversal with no inside-bar pause. On by default. Filters: HAM/SHO, FTFC, and F2 (require the prior bar to have been a Failing 2 — trapped traders fuel the move). Deep dive: [signals](concepts/signals.md).

**Inside Continuations.** Pause, then the prior move resumes. On by default. Filters: HAM/SHO, FTFC. Deep dive: [signals](concepts/signals.md).

**2-2 Continuations.** Sustained push, two directional bars the same way. Off by default because it's noisy unfiltered. Filters: HAM/SHO, FTFC. Deep dive: [signals](concepts/signals.md).

**Failing 2s (Range Reclaims).** A breakout that fails and reclaims the range — the one-bar reversal. Four detection methods (Reclaim, Open, both, either). Detection is always on for classification; the signal toggle decides whether they trade. Settings: *Signals - Reclaims*, *Advanced - Failing 2 Detection*. Deep dive: [signals](concepts/signals.md), [bar-types](concepts/bar-types.md).

**3-2 Expansions.** An outside bar's indecision resolved by the next candle committing to a side. Off by default. Deep dive: [signals](concepts/signals.md).

**Outside Bars (3 Exp).** The current candle engulfs the prior range — volatility expansion, direction from close vs open. Off by default. Deep dive: [signals](concepts/signals.md).

**Hammers & Shooters.** Candle-proportion patterns used as conviction filters or standalone signals, with three selectable definitions (Broad, Classic, Pin Bar) and an optional color match. Settings: *Filters - Hammer/Shooter Detection*. Deep dive: [bar-types](concepts/bar-types.md).

**Full Timeframe Continuity (FTFC).** Are all monitored timeframes trading above (or below) their opens right now? Shown in the table, usable as a per-signal filter, and alertable on shifts. Off as a filter by default — it filters hard, so I made it opt-in. Deep dive: [ftfc](concepts/ftfc.md).

**Lead Signal filter.** The highest timeframe with a signal in force becomes the Lead; lower timeframes only show setups that agree with it. Settings: *Filters - Lead Signal*. Deep dive: [signals](concepts/signals.md).

**Domino detection.** Consecutive inside bars stacked across timeframes — a market coiled on several scales at once. Shown in the table, alertable. Settings: *Filters - Domino Setups*. Deep dive: [signals](concepts/signals.md).

## Levels and risk

**Trigger levels.** The prior candle's high/low drawn as entry lines, styled by state: yellow/orange potential, green/red in force, gray crossed. Deep dive: [reading-labels](concepts/reading-labels.md), [drawing-decisions](engineering/drawing-decisions.md).

**Magnitude targets.** The measured first target (C2's extreme) for every actionable signal, with an "only when in force" mode. Settings: *Targets - Magnitude & Exhaustion*. Deep dive: [targets-and-stops](concepts/targets-and-stops.md).

**Exhaustion levels.** The extended target: the prior intact swing beyond magnitude, found by pivot scan. Optional "only after magnitude hit." Deep dive: [targets-and-stops](concepts/targets-and-stops.md).

**Take Action Windows.** The zone between trigger and target, shaded while an entry or add still works. Extends to exhaustion if you want. Settings: *Targets - Take Action Windows*. Deep dive: [targets-and-stops](concepts/targets-and-stops.md).

**Stop losses.** A stop on the opposite side of the trigger, CC or C1 referenced, locked for the period once a signal fires, with optional break-even moves at magnitude or exhaustion. Off by default. Settings: *Stops - Stop Levels*. Deep dive: [targets-and-stops](concepts/targets-and-stops.md).

## Display and workflow

**Data table.** Live multi-timeframe state: C2, C1, actionable-setup and current-candle columns in Strat notation (Full mode), or a compact color-coded row (Compact mode), plus FTFC, Domino, and Lead rows. Settings: *Display - Data Table*. Deep dive: [reading-labels](concepts/reading-labels.md).

**Universal labels.** The same signals in plain language — REVERSAL, CONTINUATION, INSIDE, OUTSIDE, FAILING — for traders who don't speak Strat notation yet. Settings: *Timeframe Preset → Label Style*. Deep dive: [reading-labels](concepts/reading-labels.md).

**Bar coloring** (new in v3). Chart candles painted by their Strat classification or by FTFC direction, with optional Failing-2 flip highlighting. History is graded honestly — see the changelog entry for how. Off by default. Settings: *Display - Bar Coloring*. Deep dive: [changelog](../CHANGELOG.md).

**Preview mode.** When the market is closed, the Suite shifts to next period's levels so you can plan before the open — automatic per asset class (equities, futures, crypto), with holiday handling. Settings: *Display - Preview Mode*. Deep dive: [htf-correctness](engineering/htf-correctness.md).

**Alerts.** One consolidated alert covering every enabled timeframe with optional trigger/target/stop prices in the message, plus per-timeframe, direction, potential-setup, Domino, and FTFC-shift alert conditions. Alerts fire on state changes, never on every bar. Settings: *Alerts - Detailed*. Deep dive: [settings-reference](TheStratSuite_v2.2.7_Settings_Reference.md), [repaint-prevention](engineering/repaint-prevention.md).

**No repainting.** Not a toggle — a contract. Completed-bar signals never change on reload; the rules and their receipts are documented. Deep dive: [repaint-prevention](engineering/repaint-prevention.md).

**Debug panel.** Per-timeframe internals (classification flags, draw decisions) on the chart for troubleshooting a setup that didn't draw. Settings: *Debug*. Deep dive: [drawing-decisions](engineering/drawing-decisions.md).
